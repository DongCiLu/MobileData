Agree. We discuss this in our new limitation section. The results may be limited to specific areas. However, the speed estimation method can be easily applied to similar datasets from other areas. Similar procedure can be used to study usage patterns in those datasets without much difficulty.

We use Python to analyze our dataset. More specifically, we use voronoi package from Scipy to construct voronoi maps with tower coordinates. We use another Python package called shapely to calculate various geometry values in our computation of distance lower bound. All analysis are carried out on a single Cloudlab c8220 server with two 10-core 2.2GHz E5-2660 processors and 256GB memory.
