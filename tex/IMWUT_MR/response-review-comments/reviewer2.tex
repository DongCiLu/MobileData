(R2-1) We appreciate the insightful suggestions. We have added additional arguments on the observations and their support for the conclusions in the paper. The changes can be found on page 2 in section 1.

Thank you for your comments.

>  Alternatively, running a small custom study to verify the assumptions and

>  might also be an option.

We really appreciate your constructive comments. We indeed agree that we need to demonstrate that the speed estimations to be correct. To achieve this goal, following this comment, we used a dataset collected by Intel Placelab 
to perform additional evaluations of our speed estimation algorithm. This dataset contains both cell phone data and GPS traces. We used the GPS data as the ground truth for  evaluating our speed estimation algorithm that utilizes cell phone data only. Our results show that even though the dataset was collected from a different country (US), our speed estimation algorithm worked well with same set of parameters as those used in our experiment section. We add a new evaluation section to show the results.  The changes are available in Section 5 on Page 12.  We hope that by showing that the estimation algorithm can be applied to different datasets, we are able to say with more confidence that the conclusions drawn from the city-level datasets are more reliable.
