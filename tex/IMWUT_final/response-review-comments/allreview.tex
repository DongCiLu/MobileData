\noindent Dear Editors and Reviewers,
\bigskip

Thank you very much for your insightful feedback and constructive suggestions. We have thoroughly addressed your comments %to our best effort 
in this revision. %, and list them as follows, along with our revised manuscript. 
In the following, we provide a point-to-point response to comments from each reviewer.

>  There are couple of minor things that should be addressed. I think that

>  and(f). Also I wonder there is statistically meaningful relationship in

Changes of this comment are in the 3rd paragraph at Page 16. Note that Fig.10 is changed to Fig.11 and Fig.11 is changed to Fig.12.

We have added the motivations of Fig.11 and Fig.12 at the beginning of section 6.3.

\note{Pending change. Not very sure what the reviewer asks.}

\end{verbatim}

Changes of this comment are in Table 1 at Page 16.

We add two new columns in Table 1 (Page 16) show example apps for each category and a short remark to explain most common usage of that category if necessary.

>  It would be good to have a similar plot to Fig.7 that

\end{verbatim}

Changes of this comment are in the 2nd paragraph, the 3rd paragraph and Fig.7 at page 13.

We add figure 7(a) shown the empirical CDF of the absolute error. We also add the definition of the absolute error and the discussion of the CDF of absolute error.
