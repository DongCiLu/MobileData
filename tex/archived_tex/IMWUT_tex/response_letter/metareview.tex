Our dataset is collected by a major mobile carrier in China at the cell phone tower side. All active GSM data access during a three-hour period from 6pm to 9pm on a Sunday at September 2014 were recorded. Unfortunately, the dataset only contains cellular data without any WiFi data.

a. WiFi networks.
Our response to WiFi related comments is listed under meta-review comment 4 (M4) below.

b. Time and Location contexts.
Due to the short time period of our dataset, it is not feasible for us to perform in-depth temporal or spatial analysis. We state this limitation in our new Section~\ref{limitation}.

\change{We mark the related change in paper as M2b.} 

c. Individual context.
We agree that our results only represent part of users who frequently moved and use mobile networks because of limitations in our dataset, i.e., coarse-grained location information and irregular time intervals. We state this limitation in our new limitation section.

Since it is not feasible for us to collect ground truth of user mobility in our dataset, we use a similar but much smaller dataset to perform a brief evaluation of our speed estimation algorithm. This dataset contains both cell phone data and GPS traces. We use the GPS as ground truth for the evaluation. %However, due to the small amount of data available, we were not able to perform an in-depth evaluation of our speed estimation algorithm.

Although WiFi handles half of the mobile data traffic and more than half of time users are connected to WiFi, cell phone network have much better coverage and user mobility diversity. It is more meaningful to study user mobility under cellular traffic. We do acknowledge that the lack of WiFi data is a limitation of our work and that our current speed estimation algorithm cannot be directly applied to WiFi data. However, incorporate WiFi data will change our speed estimation algorithm significantly and it is very hard to find WiFi data on a whole city scale. So we give possible solutions in our limitation section and are planning to solve it in our future works.
